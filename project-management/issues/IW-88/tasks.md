**Issue:** IW-88
**Created:** 2026-01-04
**Status:** 2/7 phases complete (29%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Recent issues - GitHub (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Search by title - GitHub (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Recent issues - Linear (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-03-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 4: Search by title - Linear (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-04-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 5: Recent issues - YouTrack (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-05-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 6: Search by title - YouTrack (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-06-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 7: Load recent on modal open (Est: 2-4h) → `phase-07-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 2/7 phases
**Estimated Total:** 30-44 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- GitHub phases (1-2) establish patterns that Linear/YouTrack phases follow
- Phase 7 is minimal - modal already exists, just needs load-on-open trigger
