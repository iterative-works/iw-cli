# Implementation Tasks: Define review-state.json schema and provide workflow integration skills

**Issue:** IW-136
**Created:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** 3/3 phases complete (100%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: JSON Schema formally defines contract (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Validation command for review state (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [x] Phase 3: Write command for review state (Est: 8-10h) → `phase-03-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 3/3 phases
**Estimated Total:** 18-24 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Story order follows dependency chain: schema → validation → write
