# Code Review: Phase 3 - Integrate llms.txt with skill

**Issue:** IW-126
**Phase:** 3
**Reviewer:** Claude (automated)
**Date:** 2026-01-26
**Iteration:** 1/3

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 Critical | 0 |
| ⚠️ Warning | 0 |
| 💡 Suggestion | 1 |

**Result:** ✅ PASSED

## Files Reviewed

- `.claude/skills/iw-command-creation/SKILL.md`

## Findings

### Suggestions

1. **💡 Table links are relative** - The Docs column links like `[docs/Output.md](docs/Output.md)` are relative. This works when viewing in the repo root but may not resolve correctly in all contexts. However, since this is documentation for human/agent reference and the text clearly shows the path pattern `$IW_CORE_DIR/../docs/`, this is acceptable.

## What Changed

1. **"Finding Core Module Documentation" section**
   - Replaced instructions to read source files with llms.txt references
   - Added explanation of llms.txt standard format
   - Added description of what each module doc contains

2. **"Available Core Modules" table**
   - Added third column with links to docs
   - Added header pointing to llms.txt for detailed docs
   - Removed `.scala` suffixes (now referencing logical modules, not files)
   - Removed Tmux and WorktreePath from table (not in current public API)

3. **Tips section**
   - Added new tip #1: Read llms.txt first
   - Added new tip #5: Read module docs
   - Removed tip about reading source files

## Verification

- [x] YAML frontmatter valid
- [x] Path resolution tested: `$IW_CORE_DIR/../llms.txt` works
- [x] All referenced docs exist in `.iw/docs/`
- [x] Markdown structure intact

## Conclusion

Clean documentation update. The skill now correctly points agents to llms.txt instead of source files, completing the documentation discoverability loop established in Phases 1 and 2.
