## Setup

- [x] [setup] Read phase context and previous implementation log
- [x] [setup] Review current Mermaid transformation code in MarkdownRenderer.scala

---

## Tests

- [x] [test] Write unit test for sequence diagram code block transformation
- [x] [test] Write unit test for class diagram code block transformation

- [x] [test] Write unit test for pie chart code block transformation
- [x] [test] Run all tests to verify they pass

---

## Implementation

- [x] [impl] Create test fixture markdown file with multiple diagram types
- [x] [impl] Create manual E2E test markdown file with diagram examples

---

## Verification

- [ ] [verify] Run artifact viewer and verify sequence diagram renders
- [ ] [verify] Run artifact viewer and verify class diagram renders
- [ ] [verify] Run artifact viewer and verify state diagram renders
- [ ] [verify] Run artifact viewer and verify pie chart renders
- [ ] [verify] Verify no regressions to flowchart diagram (Phase 1)
- [ ] [verify] Verify error handling still works (Phase 2)
