**Issue:** IW-63
**Created:** 2025-12-27
**Status:** 0/1 phases complete (0%)

## Phase Index

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 0/1 phases
**Estimated Total:** 2-3 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Single phase: all infrastructure exists, this is CLI orchestration only
