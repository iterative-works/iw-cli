# Implementation Tasks: Add host/interface configuration option to dashboard server

**Issue:** IWLE-110
**Created:** 2025-12-21
**Status:** 2/3 phases complete (67%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Configure dashboard to bind to multiple interfaces (Est: 4-5h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Display bound hosts in server status (Est: 1-2h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Warn users about security implications (Est: 1h) → `phase-03-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 2/3 phases
**Estimated Total:** 6-8 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1; Phase 3 can run parallel with Phase 2
