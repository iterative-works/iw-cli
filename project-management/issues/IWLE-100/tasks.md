# Implementation Tasks: Add server dashboard for worktree monitoring

**Issue:** IWLE-100
**Created:** 2025-12-19
**Status:** 5/7 phases complete (71%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: View basic dashboard with registered worktrees (Est: 8-12h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Automatic worktree registration from CLI commands (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [x] Phase 3: Server lifecycle management (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-03-context.md`
- [x] Phase 4: Show issue details and status from tracker (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-04-context.md`
- [x] Phase 5: Display phase and task progress (Est: 8-12h) → `phase-05-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 6: Show git status and PR links (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-06-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 7: Unregister worktrees when removed (Est: 3-4h) → `phase-07-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 5/7 phases
**Estimated Total:** 43-60 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Phase order follows recommended implementation sequence from analysis:
  1. Foundation (server, state, routes, HTML)
  2. CLI integration for workflow usability
  3. Lifecycle management to solidify infrastructure
  4. Tracker integration adds value
  5. Progress tracking (complex, deferred until stable base)
  6. Git/PR visibility enhancement
  7. Cleanup as final touch
