# Implementation Tasks: Dashboard: Display workflow review artifacts from state file

**Issue:** #46
**Created:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** 6/6 phases complete (100%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Display artifacts from state file (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Path validation security (Est: 2-3h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [x] Phase 3: View artifact content (Est: 8-12h) → `phase-03-context.md`
- [x] Phase 4: Review status and phase display (Est: 3-4h) → `phase-04-context.md`
- [x] Phase 5: Review state caching (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-05-context.md`
- [x] Phase 6: Graceful error handling (Est: 3-4h) → `phase-06-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 6/6 phases
**Estimated Total:** 26-37 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Phase order follows recommended sequence from analysis (security before content viewing)
