# Implementation Tasks: Dashboard - Restructure root page as projects overview

**Issue:** IW-205
**Created:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** 1/3 phases complete (33%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Project cards show worktree count and summary status (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 2: Remove flat worktree list from root page (Est: 2-3h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Simplify DashboardService after worktree list removal (Est: 2-3h) → `phase-03-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 1/3 phases
**Estimated Total:** 10-14 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use ag-implement to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 (enhanced project cards make root page self-sufficient)
- Phase 3 depends on Phase 2 (removes dead code left by Phase 2)
