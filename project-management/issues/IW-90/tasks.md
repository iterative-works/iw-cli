# Implementation Tasks: Support GitLab issue tracker via glab

**Issue:** IW-90
**Created:** 2026-01-04
**Status:** 2/7 phases complete (29%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Fetch and display GitLab issue via glab CLI (Est: 6-8h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Handle GitLab-specific error conditions gracefully (Est: 3-4h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: Configure GitLab tracker during iw init (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-03-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 4: GitLab issue URL generation in search and dashboard (Est: 2-3h) → `phase-04-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 5: Create GitLab issues via glab CLI (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-05-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 6: GitLab issue ID parsing and validation (Est: 3-4h) → `phase-06-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 7: Integration testing with real glab CLI (Est: 4-6h) → `phase-07-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 2/7 phases
**Estimated Total:** 26-37 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Stories ordered by recommended implementation sequence from analysis
