# Implementation Tasks: Dashboard caches (progressCache, prCache) never populated, causing data loss on refresh

**Issue:** IW-164
**Created:** 2026-01-26
**Status:** 2/3 phases complete (67%)

## Phase Index

- [x] Phase 1: Review state regression test (Est: 1h) → `phase-01-context.md`
- [x] Phase 2: Progress bars persist across card refresh (Est: 2-3h) → `phase-02-context.md`
- [ ] Phase 3: PR links persist across card refresh (Est: 1-2h) → `phase-03-context.md`

## Progress Tracker

**Completed:** 2/3 phases
**Estimated Total:** 4-6 hours
**Time Spent:** 0 hours

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Story order optimized: establish working pattern first (Story 3), then apply to progress (Story 1), then PR (Story 2)
- All stories follow same fix pattern - could be combined into single iteration if desired
