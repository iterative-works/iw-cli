## Story-to-Phase Mapping

| Phase | Story | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Story 7 | Display help when no arguments provided |
| 2 | Story 1 | Create GitHub issue with title and description |
| 3 | Story 5 | Handle missing prerequisites gracefully |
| 4 | Story 6 | Create issue with title only (minimal usage) |
| 5 | Story 2 | Create Linear issue with title and description |
| 6 | Story 3 | Create GitLab issue with title and description |
| 7 | Story 4 | Create YouTrack issue with title and description |

## Notes

- Phase context files generated just-in-time during implementation
- Use `/iterative-works:ag-implement` to start next phase automatically
- Estimates are rough and will be refined during implementation
- Phases ordered for incremental delivery: help → GitHub → validation → polish → other trackers
- Each phase delivers a working vertical slice
